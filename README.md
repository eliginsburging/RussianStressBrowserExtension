# RussianStressBrowserExtension

Google Chrome extension that fetches stresses for Russian text.

Enter a text with at least one Russian word which needs stress (i.e., at least one Russian word that contains at least two vowels and does not contain ё).
The extension will query где-ударение.рф to fetch the stress options for each word requiring stress and will generate a new version of the text you searched with the russian stresses marked.

The extension stores previously searched words locally to speed replacement in future searches.
